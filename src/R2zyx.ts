/**
 * 3 angles about new axes in the zyx order are found from a rotation matrix.
 *
 * 3 angles z,y,x about new axes (intrinsic) in the order z-y-x are found from
 * the rotation matrix R_AB. The angles (called Euler angles or Taitâ€“Bryan
 * angles) are defined by the following procedure of successive rotations:
 *
 * Given two arbitrary coordinate frames A and B. Consider a temporary frame T
 * that initially coincides with A. In order to make T align with B, we first
 * rotate T an angle z about its z-axis (common axis for both A and T).
 * Secondly, T is rotated an angle y about the NEW y-axis of T. Finally, T is
 * rotated an angle x about its NEWEST x-axis. The final orientation of T now
 * coincides with the orientation of B.
 *
 * The signs of the angles are given by the directions of the axes and the right
 * hand rule.
 *
 * Note that if A is a north-east-down frame and B is a body frame, we have that
 * z = yaw, y = pitch and x = roll.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/FFI-no/n-vector/blob/f77f43d18ddb6b8ea4e1a8bb23a53700af965abb/nvector/R2zyx.m
 *
 * @param R_AB - 3x3 rotation matrix (direction cosine matrix) such that the
 *   relation between a vector v decomposed in A and B is given by: v_A = R_AB *
 *   v_B.
 *
 * @returns Angles of rotation about new axes.
